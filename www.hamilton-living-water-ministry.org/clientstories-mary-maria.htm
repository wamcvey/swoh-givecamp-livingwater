<h2>Mary & Maria</h2>

<p>Mary was vivacious and outgoing, talkative and fun.  She was a cheerleader.  Maria was moody, angry, depressed and, at the time, not very likeable.  However, when they were at the Teen Center or the RESPECT meeting, both girls were relaxed and got along easily with others.  In the 4+ years that these girls have been in RESPECT they have made substantial progress.</p> 
 
<p>Each now maintains a 2.5 to 3.0 GPA.  Mary is employed by this ministry as a lead aide in the Children's Center and now has four years of experience.  She is also employed in the fast food industry.  Maria is also employed in the fast food industry and is a trained aide in a nursing home.  She is paying the tuition for her 6-year-old niece to attend a charter school.  Maria has organized a dance team, selects appropriate music and choreographs some of their routines.  Mary is active in cheerleading and Maria is a strong athlete in track and basketball.  They have blossomed into confident, competent individuals.  They just graduated from high school in June 2007.  Both are planning to attend college or vocational training in the fall.  Their older sister now has two small children, an example of the cycle of poverty for many young women in this area.  However, the these girls have a bright future ahead of them due in part to their involvement with Hamilton Living Water and the RESPECT Program.</p>
