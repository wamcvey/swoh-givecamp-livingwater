<h1>Boyz2Men Program</h1>

<h2>What is Boyz2Men?</h2>
<p>Boyz2Men is a mentoring program for teen boys.  Boys may enter the program in grade seven through eight, and the program continues throughout high school.</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>We work intensively with teenage boys who are at high risk of becoming teen fathers, involved in gang activity, and other negative behaviors.  Boyz2Men helps the boys to develop self-esteem and teaches the life skills they need to be successful in school, work, dating and other relationships.</p>
	        
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The boys meet weekly to discuss topics such as:
<ul>
<li>Decision-making skills and consequences</li>
<li>Goal setting and future planning</li>
<li>Abstinence and human sexuality</li>
<li>Drug, alcohol and tobacco use prevention</li>
<li>The negative influences of TV, radio, movies and advertising</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>The program helps boys gain knowledge, responsibility, self-esteem, and good decision-making skills. These qualities are strengthened by the friends made and confidences, as well as by the influence and involvement of each boy's mentor.</p>

<p>Each boy who stays with the program and graduates from high school with a 2.5 GPA or above, without becoming a teen father, will be given a partial scholarship to the college of his choice.</p>
