<h2>Matt</h2>

<p>We first met Matt in the summer of 2004.  He walked through our doors with a younger brother and the biggest smile on his face.  We enjoyed getting to know him and his family throughout the summer.  Once the school year began, Matt attended our Children's Center each day.  We soon noticed that he was having difficulty academically.  After talking to his parents, we discovered he has a learning disability which was preventing him from reading and doing simple math problems. </p>
 
<p>Matt continued to work with his America Reads tutor 3 days a week and also received tutoring daily from a volunteer at the Center.  Matt brought us his first A+ spelling test, which consisted of 5 three-letter words that he had finally mastered! His tutors initially were unsure how to proceed in helping this lovely child overcome his severe limitations in learning.  We obtained a copy of his IEP from the school and began to work towards each goal listed.  Our tutors found ways to be "creative" in teaching Matt, often using a stopwatch, sports literature, and other visuals relating to his passion for sports.</p>
  
<p>Matt is now in the 7th grade and is making slow but steady progress to meet his academic goals.  Matt amazes us as he has such a strong desire to learn, despite his limitations.  On any given day you will find him in "his spot" at the Center, working one-on-one with his tutor.  Learning has a whole new meaning to him, and he continues to surprise us each day with his persistence and enthusiasm.  We know there is a bright future for this enthusiastic young man.</p>
