<h2>Elena</h2>

<p>Elena is a single mother of two children.  She moved to the community this past year, looking for work.  Her second child was born this past October at Fort Hamilton Hospital.  Unfortunately, her son was born with an illness that required an extended stay in the hospital for tests and treatment.  Elena did not have health insurance.  The social worker who spoke to Elena at the hospital did not speak Elena's native language and therefore she did not fully understand that she may be eligible for assistance from programs like Medicare and WIC.  Elena shared her concerns about the cost of her son's health care with a neighbor, who recommended that she contact the Neighborhood Service Center for assistance.</p>
 
<p>Elena came to the Neighborhood Service Center and explained the situation.  When our NSC Coordinator realized that she had not understood the social worker at the hospital, he explained that Medicare and WIC were available to her, gave her an application, and helped her fill out the form.  Our Coordinator and Elena went back to the hospital to speak to the social worker.  Our Coordinator provided translation services to facilitate the completion of her applications, which were submitted and approved.  When she took her son for a follow-up appointment later, the costs were covered and everything went smoothly.  Elena called us after the visit to say how grateful she was that her son can now get the treatment he needs, which would have been financially impossible without Medicare.</p>
