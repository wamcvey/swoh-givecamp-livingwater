<h1>Neighborhood Service</h1>


<h2>Neighborhood Service Center</h2>
<p>The Neighborhood Service Center (NSC) is a resource center for all community residents in the 2nd and 4th wards of Hamilton, as well as surrounding communities.  The goal of the NSC is to connect individuals in need with the agencies, offices, churches and/or individuals who are available to assist them.  In addition, we strive to be an accurate source of information on a variety of topics to the residents in our community. Further, we work to promote racial and ethnic harmony within the community.</p>

<p>Clients come to NSC seeking help with things such as:
<ul>
<li>obtaining medical care and/or medications</li>
<li>questions about the local school district</li>
<li>obtaining food and clothing</li>
<li>finding and maintaining housing and utilities</li>
<li>advice on legal, educational and family issues</li>
<li>information about federal &amp; state assistance programs as well as the application process</li>
<li>translation service</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sycamore Street Garden</h2>
<p>Located on a formerly vacant lot next to the William E. Teets Administration Building, the Sycamore Street Garden offers a place of beauty and peace and a place to test your green thumb. The garden is filled with flowers, a place to rest and renew on our hand-built benches, and 16 mini-plots which grow a variety of food for the HLWM Children's Center summer program.</p>

<p>The Children's Center learn basic gardening skills, food prep, food and nutrition and are introduced to new food in our culturally diverse garden.</p>
